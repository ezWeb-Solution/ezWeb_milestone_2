## Motivation
A personal website can be crucial in allowing others to gauge the capability of an individual in their respective field. For example, a real estate agent may benefit from having a personal website that details all of his/her previous transactions. Being able to showcase their portfolios serves as a great way for them to instill confidence in potential clients, which may lead to them onboarding more clients.

However, creating a personal website is not easy. Currently, there are two options available for those who want to make their own site. Option 1 is to design your own website through web builders that claim to provide a no-brainer solution to those in need of a website. However, these web builders often have a steep learning curve and learning how to use them efficiently may require hours of tutorials and practice.
### Examples of what non-technically inclined person may be up against when deciding to create their own website:

Clearly, these web builders aren't as simple to use as they are advertised to be. The average real estate agent would face many hurdles in trying to set up an aesthetically-pleasing website. In addition, maintaining the website and getting their website indexed by search engines will require some technical know-how. These hurdles may seem too daunting and they may end up giving up altogether.
