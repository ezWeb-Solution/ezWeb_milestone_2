# Project Info
Team members: Li Chengyue & Sean Spencer Manik

Proposed level of achievement: Artemis

# Motivation
A personal website can be crucial in allowing others to gauge the capability of an individual in their respective field. For example, a real estate agent may benefit from having a personal website that details all of his/her previous transactions. Being able to showcase their portfolios serves as a great way for them to instill confidence in potential clients, which may lead to them onboarding more clients.

However, creating a personal website is not easy. Currently, there are two options available for those who want to make their own site. Option 1 is to design your own website through web builders that claim to provide a no-brainer solution to those in need of a website. However, these web builders often have a steep learning curve and learning how to use them efficiently may require hours of tutorials and practice.
## Examples of what non-technically inclined person may be up against when deciding to create their own website:
![WebDesign_tutorials2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/170931424-61abd339-20c5-4207-b876-d014d9e6ca87.jpg)
![WebDesign_tutorials3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/170931440-da898648-3dce-48f6-956c-f84601e3be83.jpg)
![WebDesign_tutorials4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/170931446-a908d229-46b9-43f0-8118-dde5904b470f.jpg)

Clearly, these web builders aren't as simple to use as they are advertised to be. The average real estate agent would face many hurdles in trying to set up an aesthetically-pleasing website. In addition, maintaining the website and getting their website indexed by search engines will require some technical know-how. These hurdles may seem too daunting and they may end up giving up altogether.

Option 2 would be to seek the help of freelance web designers to help you out. However, their services may be costly and the quality of the websites designed may differ greatly between different freelancers, and there is no guarantee that you will get a satisfactory website after all. Furthermore, when you want to update the website to expand your portfolio in future, it is likely that you will have to pay for the services of freelancers again, which makes a tedious and costly process. 

## User Story

As a real estate agent who has just started, I want to have a cheap and easy way to create a personal website as it will make me seem like a more credible agent. I would also like to have my past successful transactions displayed to instill confidence in my clients that I am able to service their needs effectively. As I execute more transactions, I would also like to be able to periodically update my portfolio with just a few simple clicks, without needing to reach out to a tech professional to help me out.


As someone who is looking to purchase a property, I want to know more about my agent. In the event that my agent would like to direct me to their page, I would like it to be easily navigable and aesthetically pleasing. More importantly, I want to be able to quickly assess the skill set of my prospective agent through viewing his/her portfolios.

## Our Solution
Almost every has had experience with messaging apps such as Telegram and Whatsapp. Hence, our solution will offer users with a user-friendly way to set up their site. Users will only have to interact with our Telegram bot to set up their personal websites, and will also be able to update the content through the bot. This allows for a very efficient and simple way for individuals to manage and update their sites. A few beautiful and thoughtfully-designed templates will be offered for users to pick from. Given that our target audience will be from the same industry (Real Estate), we will be able to tailor these templates to their needs, thus ensuring that they will be able to build relevant websites that benefits their careers. 

Most real estate agents are currently registered under PropertyGuru, and as such, they have a personal page created on PropertyGuru. The process of managing oneâ€™s personal page is not simple, and users have to pay a high fee to keep their personal pages up ($3,000 per 12 months for the Advance plan). In addition, users do not get their own domain name, such as perrysiow.com, and instead have their website registered as a subdomain of PropertyGuru.com, such as https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/agent/timothy-tan-431805.

We also hope to provide users with real-time traffic analytics, which can allow them to accurately determine if the site is effective in helping them convert visitors into paying clients. This will then allow them to develop better personal branding strategies that will provide them with a valuable edge over competing agents.

# Product-Market Fit Evaluation
## Personal Investigation
We have decided on this solution primarily due to our previous experiences. We have previously worked as freelance website designers and have set up personal websites for real estate agents, and we have found that there are a common set of features requested by real estate agents, and we realized that this area of demand could certainly be filled with a template site-builder. Moreover, given that most real estate agents have come to us, freelancers, for help with creating their website, we are confident that there is demand for such services and people are willing to pay for sites to be built for them. 

## Conversations with real estate agents
In addition, we approached relatives of ours who worked in the real estate industry as agents and asked about how common it was for real estate agents to have their own sites. From what we have gathered, a large proportion of higher performing real estate agents have personal sites, which can be attributed to them having stronger portfolios to display. However, we also found that there was a strong demand for new personal sites being created for new development listings (E.g. Property agents request for a separate site for customers to find out more and contact them for the upcoming Sengkang Grand development). From this, we concluded that we can potentially expand our target audience to include those who want development-exclusive sites.

## Mentor Consultation
We consulted our mentor with our idea regarding his views on the demand for our product. Through our prior investigation into the industry, we were able to gather sufficient anecdotal evidence to support our belief that there was a need for our product. Our mentor agreed that there may be a market for our product, and subsequently, we worked on identifying additional website features that real estate agents were interested in (done by scrutinizing existing real estate agent personal sites), which allowed us to settle on the main features of posts, listings, agent details, testimonials, and clients served.

# Features
The features of our solution can be separated into three main components - the Telegram bot, our database, and our backend site-generator.

## Telegram bot
Our Telegram bot will be designed in a manner such that it offers a fool-proof way for clients to set up, design, upload information, and manage their site through the form of automated conversation. 

![workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/170936274-f5ce2617-193f-41f0-a192-33469920eedf.jpg)
### Workflow of the Telegram bot
1. The bot will first allow the client to choose whether he/she would like to create a new site, or manage their current websites.
2. Upon choosing to create a new site, the bot will then take in the desired url of the user.
3. The url will be checked for its availability. Upon confirming its availability, its respective hosting costs will be presented to the user for confirmation.
4. After the url has been confirmed, the user is prompted to input their desired website description, upload their desired profile picture, and upload an excel file that contains information about their past transactions.
5. The user will then be provided with a list of templates that they can choose from for their site.
6. Once the relevant details has been confirmed, the user will be prompted to make a payment for the web hosting costs.
7. After payment capture, the details will then be sent to our database, where our backend site-generator will retrieve these information to be used in the process of generating the site.
8. The site will be expected to be generated in about 15-20 minutes, upon which the site will go live.
9. Users can then interact with the bot whenever they want to manage and update the information on their websites through a simple conversation with the bot.

### Content Modification
1. The user instructs the Telegram bot to delete or update existing content, or to upload new content to the site.
2. The Telegram bot receives the request and the new content, then passes it to our database.
3. Our backend then processes this data and updates the site accordingly.

### Website analytics
1. The user instructs the Telegram bot to retrieve traffic information of the web page.
2. The Telegram bot receives the request and forwards the request to our backend.
3. The backend then retrieves the traffic information and sends it back to the Telegram bot, after which, the analytics data will be displayed to the user for their perusal.

## Proposed Website Design Elements
Since our initial target audience are real estate agents, our site templates will be tailored to their needs. This will allow us to maximize customizability based on what we believe the target audience wants. We plan to interview local real estate agents to get their input on which elements of a website will be the most important to them. Currently, these are our proposed website design elements, which will serve as the skeleton for all our templates.

### Hero banners
To begin, each site will have to be able to display a default hero banner where the user will be able to replace the hero banner with a photo of themselves. This is done in order to create a strong first impression for site visitors. According to web design industry standards, a well-designed hero banner helps to increase engagement and consequently, conversion rates, due to the fact that humans are highly visual in nature. 

Example of a hero banner, taken from Oceana.org.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/170986452-f5d738e3-8a4f-4c38-9769-4d0de73b0d2d.png" width="1000" height="400">

### Block displays
Block displays should be used to neatly display a list of properties that the agent has successfully transacted. This manner of display will allow for visitors to be able to get a clear idea of the volume of transactions that the agent has processed, as well as the type of property transactions that the agent generally handles. The visual nature of block displays also serves to keep visitors engaged, which may then result in higher lead generation.

### About me section
An 'About me' section will be generated with a generic copywritten paragraph of what the agent strives to achieve and what they stand for. This section will help visitors to get to know the agent better, and will serve as a strong indicator of whether the agent will be suitable for the visitor/potential client.

Example of an engaging 'About me' section design, retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSQ2cEVbAI&ab_channel=Onlinewebustaad.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/170986863-77c88111-34bf-4003-b0a0-fba9605b6fd0.jpg" width="800" height="400">


### Testimonials 
A testimonial section will be generated where agents can include testimonials provided by past clients. Having a testimonial has been shown to increase lead generation rates, and is thus a powerful tool that we will be taking advantage in order to optimize visitor engagement rates.

Example of a well-designed testimonial section, retrieved from kissmetrics.io
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/170987558-05d4d2f1-6d2e-4689-b093-f3ab4c24cd2d.jpg" width="700" height="400">

### Contact me section
This section will arguably be the most important part of the website, where visitors are provided with a call-to-action. Visitors who are interested in consulting the agent can provide their contact details, which will then be sent to the email address of the agent. The agent will then be able to follow up on this new lead, thus potentially converting this lead to a new paying client.

## Upload of New Listings Data
As agents will want to upload information about their past transactions, it will be more efficient for them to perform the upload via an excel sheet, where they will be able to fill in information in an excel file formatted by us. Upon including all relevant data about their portfolio, the excel file can then be submitted to our Telegram bot, which will then send the file to our database, where we will be processing the data to be updated on the website.

We will be providing a formatted excel sheet with pre-defined fields that users just have to fill in.

 <br>
The Telegram bot serves as the user interface and collects user input -> Input is then stored in the ezWeb database & sent to ezWeb's backend -> ezWeb backend processes the input and carry out necessary actions such as creation of website or CRUD operations for individual sites

### Milestone 1 - Prototype Demo
Click the following link to view our prototype demo. In this demo, we sent a request to create a new website through the telegram bot, which then sends the request's data to our database, where our backend retrieves the data to generate a simple site based on the given url.

### Post Milestone 1 Reflections
#### Limitations and Struggles
We initially wanted to add more basic features to the bot and the website, but faced numerous limitations in the process to do so, which we will be documenting in this section.
<br/>

##### Inline Buttons
At first, our prompt/response flow was driven by text commands such as '/yes' or '/no', which served as a poor user experience. Fortunately, Telegram has provided well-documented alternative that uses inline buttons as a way to provide users with options to click on. This switch has drastically improved how the bot is interacted with, and we managed to reduce the total number of text commands to just three, with the rest of the bot's prompt/response flow being driven by inline buttons.

Example of inline buttons in use:

![manage_websites](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175877014-92722d43-c545-451b-bee2-9cc766a6e188.jpg)
<br/>

##### Photo Uploads
Telegram bots are generally not designed to receive photo uploads from users, and as such, there were very few examples available online on how this could be done. We were unable to successfully implement a photo capture protocol for the bot in time, and will focus on implementing it as our main priority, due to its importance in our 'create listings' and 'add agent details' function.
<br/>

##### Integrating Secure Payment Systems
Being able to successfully integrate a secure payment system will be crucial for our bot to evolve into a working and sustainable product. However, we lacked the confidence to be able to implement it in time for Milestone 1 as the documentation for it was not too comprehensive, and we needed much more time to experiment with it before implementing it into our bot.
<br/>

##### Design of Site
As we focused on the successful generation of the site, we had little time to design the site. For that reason, the generated site looked amateurish and improving its design will be one of our main priorities moving forward.
<br/>

#### Feedback Received 
We have received feedback from our submission in Milestone 1 and the areas of improvement mentioned will be stated below. We plan to take these feedback into heavy consideration and will integrate the excellent suggestions provided into our prototype.
<br/>

##### Unintuitive Navigation
One of the feedback we received was that every time a user wants to use the bot, they would have to input '/start' in order to begin using the bot. It was suggested that we implemented a menu to improve user experience.
<br/>

##### Unable to Test
Currently, the bot is being run locally on our laptops, and thus we are not able to facilitate the testing of the bot. We plan to either run our bot on the cloud, or allow testers to specify a date and time where they would like to test the bot, after which we will keep the bot running on our end. 
<br/>

### Post Milestone 2 Reflections
#### Limitations and Struggles
We were able to add integrate most of the website's features with the Telegram bot, and have extensively tested the bot to fix bugs that appeared along the way. However, there are a few minor features that we have yet to implement as it was either not a priority, or we were unable to confidently implement it as of Milestone 2.

##### Payment Testing
Currently, we are only able to test the payments on a Test Mode. For now, it has worked well as we are able to detect and confirm successful payments on our payments provider, Stripe. However, we were unable to test the bot out of Test Mode as that would require us to make actual payments, of which Stripe would be taking a cut of. We are planning to test the bot once with real payments to ensure that it works well by the end of Milestone 3.

##### Edit Listings
After successfully implementing the create and delete listings function, the next step would have been to add the 'Edit Listings' function. However, there are too many parts of a single listing and we took some time to a concrete conclusion on how we would like the prompt/response flow to look like. There were two possibilities.
1. Upon choosing the 'Edit Listing' option, the user would be prompted to provide a whole new set of details for the listing. This would be the much easier option, but would certainly not be as user friendly as we would have liked it to be.
2. Upon choosing the 'Edit Listing' option, the user would be asked which part of the listing they would like to edit. Currently, there are a total of five fields as seen below that they would be allowed to choose from. However, within each field, there may be multiple subfields/photos which we will have to create separate API calls for updating. 
- Title (Input string)
- Property Details, such as property type, number of rooms, address, tenure, total area, floor, price, and number of storeys (Input string)
- Description (Input string)
- Featured photo (.jpg/.png upload)
- Extra display photos (.jpg/.png upload)
As of now, we are planning to go with option 2, but this will take quite a bit of time to implement and will implementing the 'Edit Listings' function as our top current priority.

##### Edit Agent Details
The 'Edit Agent Details' function suffered from the same problems as mentioned in the 'Edit Listings' section. There were too many fields that would have required an extensive amount of time to include and test, which was why we have decided to implement it at a later stage and direct our atttention to ensuring that key features of the product were able to function properly at this time.

##### Agent Interviews
We intended to interview actual real estate agents to get more feedback on whether our product served as a sufficiently powerful product-market fit. However, we decided against conducting interviews prematurely and have decided to interview real estate agents at a later stage once we have a product that they can test. This would allow us to:
1. Receive feedback on whether our product fulfills their needs.
2. Find out if the design of the website is comparable to industry standards.
3. Receive suggestions on what other key features real estate agents would like to have integrated.

#### Feedback Received
To be added...

# Software Engineering Practices
During the process of implementing our solution, we have tried our best to ensure that good software engineering practices were being employed, so as to maximise what we have learnt during this process.

## Incremental Code Development
We started from the most basic proof of concept which is to automate the registration of domain, set up DNS records, configure wordpress backend, and set up a hosting environment. On the frontend, we started by ensuring that responses provided by users were able to be captured successfully and sent. This allowed us to build up upon what we had and we were then able to slowly add in more features such as listings, posts, and home page customization.

## Weekly Code Review
Since we separated our responsibilities into primarily backend and frontend, we regularly reviewed each other's code, at least once per week, to ensure that we were maintaining compatibility in our code and were working towards the same goals. This was particularly important since our respective sections of our system had to regularly send and receive data to and from one another as part of the functionality of our product.

## Separation of Concerns 
Early on, we have identified that the ezWeb backend and Telegram bot could be separated into two distinct sections. By separating and defining the requirements of each section clearly, we were quickly able to build and deploy new functions and test them separately, without one section affecting the other. 

In addition, the separation of concern principle was utilized within the Telegram bot effectively, which allowed functions to be used separately without affecting the others, thus drastically improving how we were able to identify and fix bugs that occured during testing. This also allowed us to add new functionality to our prototype without having to worry about the entire system being unexpectedly affected.

## Collaboration Tools
Our project can be split into two main sections, the Telegram bot frontend, and the WordPress backend. Each of us took charge of one main section each and had to find a way to work closely together to ensure smooth collaboration. In order to maintain a strong and consistent level of communication, we used collaborative tools such as Trello to keep track of tasks. We also communicated via messaging platforms to ensure that we were both on the same page when it came to implementing new functions together.

Example of collaborative tool we used:
![Screenshot 2022-06-27 202545](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175942298-98365cb5-8afb-433c-9fe2-a68a1234b781.jpg)

## CI/CD
We separately took a Github course on Codecademy in anticipation of Milestone 3 where more features will be implemented. This is because the project code base has become rather large and harder to maintain, whereby the benefits of CI/CD are apparent.

## Testing
### Regression Testing
As we added numerous functions that required extensive code for the Telegram bot prompt/response flow, we frequently encountered unexpected bugs that arose during testing. Hence, we decided early on that Regression Testing was necessary for us so as to ensure that every bug was dealt with as soon as possible to ensure a smoother deployment of new features in the future. Thus far, testing has been done after every major functionality implementation, such as:
New Feature  | Bugs Identified and Resolved | Date
------------ | ------------- | -----
URL Checker | Prices at 1,000,000x the actual value was returned | 13 June
URL Checker | Data sent to backend via post request were of incompatible types | 13 June

Test Payments | Invalid price amount type | 14 June
Test Payments | Test payments did not register properly | 14 June
Test Payments | Site generating API was not called after payment succeess | 14 June
Send Photo Data | URL sent via post request did not contain the image, image had to be downloaded separately | 16 June
Send Photo Data | Persistent server error, problem was found to be a minor syntax error | 16 June
Edit Posts | Change to how posts were retrieved resulted in bugs appearing in earlier functionalities | 18 June
Edit Posts | When post content was too long, post could not be retrieved properly | 18 June
Agent Details | Incorrect item attributes resulted in bot freezing | 24 June
Create Listing | Incorrect item attributes | 26 June
Create Listing | Minor type error relating to how inline buttons were used | 26 June

### Unit Testing - Manual
Individual components that made up crucial parts of the final product were individually tested before deploying it as part of the main solution. This was to ensure that additional features can be integrated into the overall system smoothly.
Individual Components Tested | Approach
----- | ------
Create Website | Function could be tested separately from everything else via Telegram bot

Create Posts | Individual testing was used to confirm that calls to endpoints were worked properly and could enact a successful change
Edit Posts | Separate testing was used to identify optimal way of retrieving posts
Delete Posts | Separate testing was used to identify optimal way of retrieving posts
Inline buttons | Inline buttons as a new user interface element was tested separately to confirm its feasibility for use
Payments | Payment protocol was implemented as a standalone function for successful payments to be simulated and tested
Photo Capture | Photo capture function was implemented as a standalone function which allowed for photo capture and dissemination to be tested and familiarized with
API Calls | Standalone POST/GET requests were made to newly made endpoints to ensure that data could be processed successfully
Create Listings | Tested separately to find out optimal prompt/response flow
Delete Listings | Function could be tested separately from everything else via Telegram bot
Add Agent Details | Tested separately to find out optimal prompt/response flow

# Working Prototype
Our Telegram bot has been set up to receive website creation requests, and capture url/description data which is sent to our database. On the backend, we will be able to retrive this data and generate a simple website on the given url.

After the site has been created, users can use the Telegram bot to create/edit/delete posts and listings, as well as add agent details to their site. This entire process accommodates photo uploads as well, thus allowing for users to be able to manage their website comfortably within the confines of their Telegram app.

## Website Creation
To start, navigate to @ezWebTest_bot to start the bot.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175896599-8149c1f7-358c-482b-ab5b-0a5ebf4fc2b0.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Data is then retrieved from our database to display all websites registered to the user. The user can then pick their desired website to create/edit/delete posts.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175896926-99e1beda-b416-4300-80c1-1ee64c92e3b2.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Following that, the user is presented with a list of actions that they can do to their website.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175897122-b2946077-389b-49f3-a47d-fe4e7de12dbf.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Upon choosing the 'Create new post' option, the user is then prompted to type in a title for his/her new post, following which, they would be asked if they would like to either confirm the title, change the title, or stop creating a post.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175897348-27abe724-c673-4980-ba9b-6ed5a9eb1742.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

After confirming the title, the user is prompted to type in the content of his/her new post. Following which, they would be asked if they would like to either confirm the content, change the content, or stop creating a post.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175897557-7d79a2ff-840a-4a59-9402-e255620e9e47.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

After confirming the content, the user is asked to confirm the upload of the new post.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175897787-cebee6cf-8c8f-4f2d-b79f-51587ff429be.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Following the confirmation of upload, the data is captured and processed in our backend, which leads to a post being generated on the user's site. After the post has been generated, a completion message is sent to the user. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175897990-2b780ec4-2a48-4dae-be32-a3d7b698fe5c.jpg" width="275" height="450">

Post editing and deletion can be done following the bot's prompts after clicking on the 'Edit posts' or 'Delete posts' options instead of 'Create new post'.

## Create Listings - Edit Listings - Delete Listings
Users who want to create new posts or edit their current posts on their website can click on the menu button, and then choose the **Manage Websites** option. Data is then retrieved from our database to display all websites registered to the user. The user can then pick their desired website to create/edit/delete posts.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175898629-a9c2ac29-9954-44bf-ac8a-d10125aae5bc.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Following that, the user is presented with a list of actions that they can do to their website.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175898774-ec7501bc-5898-405d-baca-f7c8b5a60d21.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Upon choosing the 'Create new listing' option, the user is then prompted to type in a title description for his/her new listing, following which, they would be asked if they would like to either confirm the title description and proceed with adding the property details, or cancel the process of creating a new post.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175899010-ee727aea-a0f7-4492-8bcd-eac4f089b92c.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

After choosing to proceed with adding the property details, the user is presented with a template that we have prepared for them. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175900148-c407226d-2aa8-48ec-9ae4-b11ae7464b5b.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Upon typing in the property details, the bot captures the information and repeats it back to the user for confirmation. The user can now choose whether he is happy with the property details and to proceed to add a description, or choose to change the property details or stop the process of creating a listing.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175900417-c3d84b07-5cde-4023-b1d5-67b46e4122b6.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

After the user types in the property description, the next step would be to upload a featured photo for the listing.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175900591-2b4573ab-a0d3-4a2a-970f-8e967e80f91f.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

The user uploads his/her desired photo, and the bot captures this data and repeats it back to the user for confirmation.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175900859-dfc66b1a-87c7-4987-9190-90bc73ddd8bc.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Once users are happy with their featured photo, they can proceed with adding extra photos of the listing.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175900870-fc461bf7-c70c-4a24-90df-3f2cbb2a2bcb.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

The bot prompts the user to send up to ten extra photos, with a manual command to signal that the user is done with adding extra photos.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175901166-3d497ff5-3065-4a57-8d77-657d6a818d55.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>


The user uploads nine different photos as seen below.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175901420-e85ed9e9-b0a4-4f1a-9aa9-df6989548e35.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

The bot records the number of photos uploaded and reminds the user of the command that he/she can use to signal that they are done with uploading. After uploading nine photos, the tester sends the command.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175901712-094006e1-742e-46bb-8282-3130c9ffe780.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

The bot then repeats the photos sent by the user and is asked for confirmation.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175901777-6023f1b9-68b0-4c25-95e5-74b3d1846127.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Finally, the user is prompted to confirm that they would like to upload this listing onto their website.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175901934-413cc49b-7b9e-4217-af19-622ae6fd41e0.jpg" width="275" height="450">
<br/>

Data is sent to our backend for processing, which then uses the data provided by the user to generate a new listing

![14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175902183-91fdad3c-20a6-4ee9-9019-614463baa4b0.jpg)

A few seconds after the user has confirmed the upload of the new listing, the new listing has been generated as seen below.

![15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52826683/175902321-a1659418-d0c6-42da-9c8d-f41d13a043eb.jpg)

In addition, the address provided by the user is used to include a Google Maps display of where the property is located at. This feature would help site visitors to understand the surrounding environment of the property, which may influence their interest in the property.
