## Motivation
A personal website can be crucial in allowing others to gauge the capability of an individual in their respective field. For example, a real estate agent may benefit from having a personal website that details all of his/her previous transactions. Being able to showcase their portfolios serves as a great way for them to instill confidence in potential clients, which may lead to them onboarding more clients.

However, creating a personal website is not easy. Currently, there are two options available for those who want to make their own site. Option 1 is to design your own website through web builders that claim to provide a no-brainer solution to those in need of a website. However, these web builders often have a steep learning curve and learning how to use them efficiently may require hours of tutorials and practice.
### Examples of what non-technically inclined person may be up against when deciding to create their own website:

Clearly, these web builders aren't as simple to use as they are advertised to be. The average real estate agent would face many hurdles in trying to set up an aesthetically-pleasing website. In addition, maintaining the website and getting their website indexed by search engines will require some technical know-how. These hurdles may seem too daunting and they may end up giving up altogether.

Option 2 would be to seek the help of freelance web designers to help you out. However, their services may be costly and the quality of the websites designed may differ greatly between different freelancers, and there is no guarantee that you will get a satisfactory website after all. Furthermore, when you want to update the website to expand your portfolio in future, it is likely that you will have to pay for the services of freelancers again, which makes a tedious and costly process. 

## Our Solution
Almost every has had experience with messaging apps such as Telegram and Whatsapp. Hence, our solution will offer users with a user-friendly way to set up their site. Users will only have to interact with our Telegram bot to set up their personal websites, and will also be able to update the content through the bot. This allows for a very efficient and simple way for individuals to manage and update their sites. A few beautiful and thoughtfully-designed templates will be offered for users to pick from. Given that our target audience will be from the same industry (Real Estate), we will be able to tailor these templates to their needs, thus ensuring that they will be able to build relevant websites that benefits their careers. 

Most real estate agents are currently registered under PropertyGuru, and as such, they have a personal page created on PropertyGuru. The process of managing oneâ€™s personal page is not simple, and users have to pay a high fee to keep their personal pages up ($3,000 per 12 months for the Advance plan). In addition, users do not get their own domain name, such as perrysiow.com, and instead have their website registered as a subdomain of PropertyGuru.com, such as https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/agent/timothy-tan-431805.


## User Story

As a real estate agent who has just started, I want to have a cheap and easy way to create a personal website as it will make me seem like a more credible agent. I would also like to have my past successful transactions displayed to instill confidence in my clients that I am able to service their needs effectively. As I execute more transactions, I would also like to be able to periodically update my portfolio with just a few simple clicks, without needing to reach out to a tech professional to help me out.


As someone who is looking to purchase a property, I want to know more about my agent. In the event that my agent would like to direct me to their page, I would like it to be easily navigable and aesthetically pleasing. More importantly, I want to be able to quickly assess the skill set of my prospective agent through viewing his/her portfolios.

## Features
